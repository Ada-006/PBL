    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        Agriculture remains the backbone of India’s economy, supporting nearly half of the workforce and contributing significantly to national food security and GDP. However, Indian agriculture continues to suffer from delayed crop disease detection, inefficient monitoring systems, unpredictable weather conditions, and limited access to reliable market intelligence. Traditional farming practices rely heavily on manual observation, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and often ineffective for early-stage disease detection or data-driven decision-making.
    </p>
    <p>
        This research proposes an AI-powered Smart Farming System that integrates deep learning, computer vision, and time-series forecasting techniques to address three critical agricultural challenges: crop disease detection, crop monitoring and growth analysis, and market trend prediction. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are employed for image-based disease detection, vegetation indices and segmentation methods are used for crop health assessment, and machine learning models such as LSTM and ARIMA are utilized for forecasting crop prices and demand trends. The integrated system provides actionable recommendations to farmers regarding disease management, optimal harvesting time, and profitable crop selection.
    </p>
    <p>
        The proposed framework aims to improve agricultural productivity, sustainability, and profitability through a data-driven approach aligned with the vision of precision agriculture.

<section class="section" id="introduction">
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Agriculture plays a foundational role in India’s socio-economic development. Despite technological advancements in other sectors, farming practices in many regions remain largely traditional. Farmers face recurring challenges such as crop diseases, unpredictable weather, lack of real-time monitoring, and insufficient awareness of market trends. These challenges often result in reduced crop yields, financial instability, and inefficient resource utilization.
    </p>
    <p>
        Manual crop inspection methods are slow and prone to error, particularly when early-stage disease symptoms are subtle. Additionally, market price volatility and insufficient forecasting mechanisms prevent farmers from making informed decisions regarding planting and selling strategies.
    </p>
    <p>
        With advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in deep learning and data analytics, it is now possible to analyze complex agricultural data efficiently. AI-based systems can detect disease patterns from images, evaluate crop health using vegetation indices, and predict market trends using historical time-series data. This research proposes a unified AI-driven smart farming system that integrates these capabilities into a practical and scalable solution.
    </p>

<section class="section" id="problem">
    <h2>2. Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
        Indian agriculture faces persistent challenges including delayed disease detection, inaccurate crop health monitoring, and unreliable market insights. Existing AI-based tools often address these issues independently, lacking an integrated and accessible system suitable for practical farming environments.
    </p>
    <p>There is a need to develop a comprehensive AI-powered framework capable of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Automatically detecting crop diseases from leaf or aerial images.</li>
        <li>Monitoring crop growth stages and health conditions.</li>
        <li>Forecasting market prices and demand trends.</li>
        <li>Providing actionable, farmer-friendly recommendations.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="section" id="objectives">
    <h2>3. Objectives</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To develop a deep learning-based crop disease detection system using CNN architectures.</li>
        <li>To implement a computer-vision-driven crop monitoring module using vegetation indices and segmentation techniques.</li>
        <li>To design a machine-learning-based market forecasting model for predicting crop prices and demand trends.</li>
        <li>To integrate these components into a unified decision-support system.</li>

<section class="section" id="literature">
    <h2>4. Literature Review</h2>
    <p>Extensive research has explored AI applications in agriculture.</p>
    <p>Ferentinos (2018) demonstrated that CNN architectures such as VGG and ResNet achieve over 99% accuracy in plant disease detection under controlled environments. However, performance degrades in real-field conditions due to lighting and background variability.</p>
    <p>Kamilaris and Prenafeta-Boldú (2018) conducted a survey of over 70 deep learning applications in agriculture and concluded that deep learning consistently outperforms classical machine learning approaches. Nevertheless, dataset scarcity and lack of standardization limit generalization.</p>
    <p>Too et al. (2019) compared VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet121, and MobileNet architectures. DenseNet121 achieved approximately 99.75% accuracy, while MobileNet was more suitable for mobile-based applications due to lower computational requirements.</p>
    <p>Islam et al. (2024) proposed a hybrid ResNet50-PSO-SVM model achieving 99.60% accuracy. Although promising, the model was validated primarily on small datasets.</p>
    <p>Dutta et al. (2021) improved disease detection robustness through transfer learning and data augmentation, achieving over 98% accuracy.</p>
    <p>Pan et al. (2021) integrated UAV-based multispectral imaging with CNN models to detect wheat yellow rust at early stages, demonstrating the potential of aerial monitoring.</p>
    <p>Yi et al. (2020) used Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery for crop classification with over 92% accuracy.</p>
    <p>Sun et al. (2024) developed a hybrid VMD–LSTM model for agricultural price forecasting, outperforming standalone LSTM models by capturing nonlinear seasonal trends.</p>
    <p>Dhanaraju et al. (2022) explored IoT-based smart agriculture systems and highlighted both their benefits and connectivity challenges.</p>
    <p>Dalvi et al. (2024) introduced a multi-attribute CNN model for plant recognition, improving robustness through multi-input features.</p>
    <p>While these studies show significant advancements, most focus on isolated problems. The proposed research integrates disease detection, crop monitoring, and market prediction into a unified system.</p>
